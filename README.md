# Simon-Game-using-JS
This is my first project that is built using JavaScript.
How to play the game :
Basically this is a game that can be used to test how much you can remember that is based on simple implementation of JS.
You will be given certain buttons of different colors and at each level you will have to click the buttons from level 1 to the current level to go to the next level.
Each button that is added in the current level can be identified by the blinking of that particular button.

# My Additions to The Original Game

I have Added Keyboard Shortcuts To Play the game. 
Like: For Red Box: Press r, For Green press g, For Yellow Box press y, For Blue Box press b.

There is a timer added to the game. For first level you will get 3 seconds to make the work done and for each
subsequent level 5 seconds will be added to the timer. If you are not able to click on all possible squares in
given time you will loose.

There is a score which will keep record of how are you performing in the game.
For clicking on the right square you will be assigned 5 points and if you press on wrong square game gets over plus you will loose 10 points.

In css over the squares the cursor is changed to pointer.
