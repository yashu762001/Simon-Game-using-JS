# Simon-Game-using-JS
This is my first project that is built using JavaScript.
How to play the game :
Basically this is a game that can be used to test how much you can remember that is based on simple implementation of JS.
You will be given certain buttons of differbutton that is added in new level can ent colors and at each level you will have to click the buttons from level 1 to the current level to go to the next level.
Each button that is added in the current level can be identified by the blinking of that particular button.
